# Real Estate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to residential real estate. The goal is to gain insights into various factors influencing house prices through thorough analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following tasks:

1. **Loading the Data**: We start by loading the dataset, which contains information about residential properties, into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Visualize distributions of numerical features**: Visualize the distributions of numerical features using histograms or kernel density plots to understand their spread and central tendency.

3. **Create a box plot using Matplotlib**: Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of a numerical column using Matplotlib.

4. **Cleaning the Data**: We handle missing values, fill null value, and address any anomalies present in the dataset to ensure data quality.

5. **Univariate Analysis**: We explore individual variables such as house prices to understand their distributions and characteristics.

6. **Multivariate Analysis**: We investigate relationships between multiple variables, especially those impacting house prices, using correlation matrices and heatmaps.

7. **Feature Engineering**: We create new features, such as price per square foot, to enhance our analysis and modeling capabilities.

8. **Geospatial Analysis**: We visualize house prices on a map to analyze spatial patterns and distributions. (Note: This part is currently not applicable due to the absence of longitude and latitude data in the dataset)

9. **Feature Engineering and Size Impact**: We further analyze the impact of features and size on house prices, particularly focusing on square footage.

10. **Market Trends and Historical Pricing**: We explore historical pricing trends over time, considering external factors such as economic indicators.

11. **Customer Preferences and Amenities**: We investigate how customer preferences and amenities impact house prices. (Note: This part is currently under development)

12. **Analyze Correlations**: Plot the heatmap of the correlation matrix to visualize the correlations between numerical features.

13. **Handle Categorical Variables**: Plot histograms of categorical variables to understand their frequency distribution.
